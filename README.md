# Hi there, I'm Ales Zemene 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate audio enthusiast and developer, deeply immersed in the world of sound and technology. My work revolves around several fascinating areas within audio and music production, including:

## 🎵 SuperCollider Audio
I'm an avid user of SuperCollider, a powerful platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition. With SuperCollider, I create complex soundscapes and innovative musical pieces that push the boundaries of traditional music production.

## 🎶 Algorithmic Composition
Algorithmic composition is at the heart of my creative process. I explore the intersection of music and mathematics, using algorithms to generate unique and dynamic compositions. This approach allows me to craft music that is both intricate and ever-evolving.

## 🤖 AI-Generated Tracks
Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, I develop AI-generated tracks that blend creativity with cutting-edge technology. These tracks showcase the potential of AI to augment human creativity and produce music that is both novel and captivating.

## 🎧 Elevator Music
I have a particular interest in creating elevator music, also known as Muzak. By experimenting with different styles and moods, I aim to transform the often-overlooked genre of elevator music into something intriguing and enjoyable.

## 🎛️ Modular Synthesizers
Modular synthesizers are a key component of my sound design toolkit. I enjoy building and experimenting with modular systems to produce unique sounds and textures. The hands-on nature of modular synthesis allows for endless creativity and sonic exploration.

🧪 Recent Experiments & Hardware Playground

Lately, I've been diving deep into the world of Monome Norns , an open-platform scripting environment for experimental music and sound design. This has opened up exciting avenues for exploring psychoacoustics, audio kinetics, and generative soundscapes.

🔧 Gear I'm Playing With:

Monome Norns – A versatile platform for live coding and interactive sound design.
Shield XL Raspberry Pi – Used for custom audio projects and expanding computational capabilities.
Soma Pulsar – A semi-modular synthesizer perfect for rhythmic textures and deep modulation.
Moog Subharmonicon – A unique polyrhythmic subharmonic synthesizer that adds rich harmonic layers and evolving sequences.
 🔬 Areas of Exploration:

Psychoacoustic phenomena – Binaural beats, auditory illusions, and spatial perception.
Audio Kinetics – Sound-reactive visuals, motion-triggered synthesis, and sensor integration.
Generative Systems – Creating self-evolving compositions using algorithmic logic and external modulation sources.
 Be sure to check out my latest repositories where I share scripts, patches, and documentation from these explorations!
